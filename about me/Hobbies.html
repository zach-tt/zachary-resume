      <li>
        I did swimming from 15 to 17 years old. It was always suppose to be for
        fun and fitness but they wanted me to compete in competitves so I
        stoppped. But I always have fun swimming in pools and the beach

    <h3>Watching Anime and Reading Manga</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I am one of those anime fan nerds. I have watched over 50 anime and
        counting. I generally read manga when I watch an anime and i'm too
        impatient to wait to see what happens next or if I find a highly
        recommended one I will read it
